# Rapport

## Intro

Group  members:

- Henrik Zenkert

- Jakob Hansen

- Frederik Rolsted

- Tobias Schønau

All tasks was completed in collaboration between all group members. 

## Mandatory 

We have done all the mandatory and optional assignments.


Below we have attached flowcharts describing our solutions to the mandatory assignments. 

We had diffi


### 1st - midpoint

### 2nd - readS

figure 2: This flowchart describes our implementation of the readS subroutines.
### 3rd - isPrime

figure 3: This flowchart shows the subroutine isPrime. In this subroutine, the workings of the subroutines “divide”, “ODD” etc. is hidden. To see the implementation of these subroutines, see the appendix for a full overview of the 3rd assignment.
### 4th - resultS

### 5th - full program

## Optional

### 1st - 5 digits


### 2nd - input validation
